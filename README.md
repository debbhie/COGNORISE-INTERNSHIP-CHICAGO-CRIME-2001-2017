## DATA ANALYSIS
### Total Number of crime incidents recorded: 
The crime data analysis spans from 2001 to 2017, with a total of 7,941,282 crime incidents recorded in Chicago. 

### Top 10 crime incident yearly by primary type: 
* Theft (1,639,788 incidents) is the most prevalent crime, accounting for the highest number of incidents among all categories. This high rate of theft suggests widespread issues related to property crimes. This could be driven by various factors, including economic conditions, unemployment, or inadequate security measures in both public and private spaces.
* Battery (1,442,711 incidents) which typically involves physical harm or threat, is the second most common crime. The high incidence of battery indicates significant levels of violence in the community. This points to underlying social issues such as gang activity, domestic violence, or interpersonal conflicts.
* Criminal Damage (922,993 incidents) which includes vandalism and property destruction, ranks third. The large number of criminal damage incidents suggests problems with public order and respect for property. This could be related to civil unrest, youth delinquency, or retaliatory actions.
* Narcotics (885,429 incidents) related crimes are a major issue, with nearly 900,000 incidents recorded. The high rate of narcotics crimes reflects widespread drug-related issues, including both use and trafficking. This often correlates with other crimes such as theft, violence, and gang activity, indicating a need for comprehensive drug enforcement and rehabilitation programs.
* Other Offenses (491,920 incidents) This category encompasses various less common or minor offenses. The broad nature of this category makes it harder to analyze, but it still represents a significant portion of the crime landscape. Further investigation into what specific crimes are included here could help tailor law enforcement strategies.
* Assault (481,658 incidents) which involves threats or attempts to cause physical harm, is another significant crime type. Like battery, the high number of assault incidents reflects underlying issues of violence in the community. It also indicates potential areas where conflict resolution and violence prevention programs could be beneficial.
* Burglary (470,953 incidents) involving illegal entry into buildings with intent to commit a crime, ranks seventh. The prevalence of burglary highlights security issues in residential and commercial properties. This suggests a need for improved security measures and community awareness programs to reduce such incidents.
* Motor Vehicle Theft (370,547 incidents) is a significant crime, though less common than burglary. This indicates a substantial problem with vehicle security in the area. Law enforcement could focus on improving vehicle theft prevention strategies and increasing public awareness about protective measures.
* Robbery (300,449 incidents) which involves taking property from a person by force or threat, is a notable crime. The occurrence of robbery suggests the need for better personal security measures, especially in high-risk areas. It also indicates the potential presence of organized crime or desperate individuals turning to robbery.
* Deceptive Practice (279,693 incidents) including fraud and other forms of deceit, round out the top ten. The relatively high incidence of fraud-related crimes points to issues in financial security, both online and offline. This calls for stronger consumer protection laws and awareness campaigns to prevent people from falling victim to such crimes.

### Top 10 crime incident yearly by Location: 
-  High-Risk Locations:
* Street (2,101,842 incidents) are the most common location for crimes, accounting for approximately 26.5% of all incidents. Crimes on streets are often more visible to the public, suggesting that many incidents could be related to street-level offenses such as theft, assault, or drug-related activities. The high number of crimes on streets indicates a need for increased street patrols, surveillance, and public awareness campaigns to reduce crime rates in these areas.
* Residence (1,341,749 incidents) are the second most common location for crimes, making up about 16.9% of incidents. Crimes in residences often involve domestic violence, burglary, or disputes among known individuals, which may be harder to prevent through traditional policing. This highlights the importance of neighborhood watch programs, better home security measures, and domestic violence intervention strategies.
* Sidewalk (815,595 incidents) Sidewalks, like streets, are public spaces with high pedestrian traffic, often linked to crimes such as muggings, pickpocketing, or assaults. The high incidence of crime on sidewalks calls for better lighting, public awareness, and perhaps increased foot patrols to deter criminal activities.

- Medium-Risk Locations:
* Apartment (812,512 incidents)are close in crime frequency to sidewalks, indicating a significant level of crime within multi-unit residential buildings. This could involve domestic disputes, theft, or vandalism. Security in apartment complexes should be prioritized, with measures such as improved access control, security cameras, and resident awareness programs.
* Other (294,286 incidents) This category likely includes a variety of less common crime locations, which might include areas such as parks, abandoned buildings, or industrial areas. Understanding the specific nature of these "other" locations could help tailor preventive measures to those particular environments.
* Parking Lot/Garage (Non-Residential) (225,454 incidents) Parking lots and garages are known for being relatively isolated and can be hotspots for vehicle theft, robbery, or vandalism. Enhanced security measures such as better lighting, security patrols, and surveillance systems are essential in these areas.
  
- Lower-Risk Locations:
* Alley (180,155 incidents) provide secluded areas that are attractive for crimes such as illegal dumping, drug deals, or assaults. Increased monitoring of alleys through surveillance and neighborhood involvement could help reduce crime in these hidden spots.
* School, Public Building (173,750 incidents) While these are generally safer spaces, the presence of crimes here indicates issues such as vandalism, bullying, or drug-related incidents within or near school premises. Ensuring a safe environment in schools and public buildings through security personnel, student programs, and anti-drug initiatives is crucial.
* Residence Garage (158,550 incidents) particularly in residential areas, are often targets for theft or vandalism. Reinforcing garage security, such as installing better locks and security cameras, could mitigate risks.
* Residence Porch/Hallway (138,492 incidents) Porches and hallways, as entry points to residences, are vulnerable to crimes such as burglary, package theft, or even physical assaults. Enhancing visibility, security measures, and community vigilance around these entry points can help deter potential crimes.
